# Distribution Patterns Within Predator Communities

This individual-based model programmed in NetLogo was develooped to investigate the potential interspecific drivers of distribution patterns within predator communities. The description and context of this IBM can be found in the following publication: 

[Intraguild processes drive space-use patterns in a large-bodied marine predator community](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.14108)

You are free to use, modify, and/or expand on (any parts of) the model. But if you do, please give proper credit by including our names (Maurits van Zinnicq Bergmann and Thomas Bodey), project name, and a link to the original source in your project documentation or acknowledgments. Thank you.

The web version of this model can be found by clicking on this [link](https://mauritsvzb.github.io/Distribution_Patterns_Within_Predator_Communities.html).
